Howdy!

To get things up & running, basically only need to install flask

$ pip install flask

And then you can run things straight away via

$ python shorten.py 

Should start a localhost:5000

If you'd like to access the admin (to see the list of shorten URLs) the usr/pwd are as follows:
admin
default
